# DesignWordVector
This project is about algorithms of creation of word vectors(GloVe) used for applications in Natural Language Processing. The word vectors are designed by using Python's NumPy library. This project heavily depends on mathematics.

If you want to design word vectors for NLP tasks from scratch with mathematics in detail instead of just using pre-trained word vectors, then this project is right for you!

For codes, please refer to "word_vector(GloVe).ipynb".

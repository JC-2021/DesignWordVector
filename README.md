# DesignWordVector
Algorithms of creation of word vectors(GloVe) used for applications in Natural Language Processing. 

If you want to design custom word vectors for NLP tasks from scratch with mathematics in detail instead of just using pre-trained word vectors, then this project is right for you!

For codes, please refer to "Word_Vector(GloVe).ipynb".
